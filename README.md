# Quiz App

This is a React-based web application that quizzes users on a variety of questions. The app uses the Open Trivia Database API to fetch questions in a selected category and number, then presents them to the user one at a time. Users can select their answer to each question from a set of options, and the app provides feedback on whether the answer was correct or not.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Usage

To use the app, simply navigate to the web page and select the desired category and number of questions to include in the quiz. Then, click the "Start Game" button to begin. Each question will be presented one at a time, along with a set of multiple choice options. Select an answer and wait for feedback on whether it was correct or not. After all questions have been answered, the app will display the user's score and provide an option to start a new game.
